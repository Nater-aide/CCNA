# Cabling
## Ethernet
- **1000**: Specifies a transmission speed of 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) or 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps)
- **BASE**: Refers to baseband signaling (which means that only Ethernet signals are carried on the medium)
- **T**: Represents twisted-pair cabling
---------------------------------
- **Category 5**: Capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 100 Mbps
- **Category 5e**: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
- **Category 6**: Comprises four pairs of 24-gauge copper wires, which can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
- **Category 6a**: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
- **Category 7**: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
- **Category 8**: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 40 Gbps
----------------------------------
- **LC**: is for enterprise equipment and is commonly used on Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) modules.
- **SC**: is for enterprise equipment.
- **ST**: is for patch panels (for their durability).
- **FC**: is for patch panels and is used by service providers.
- **MT-RJ**: the connector is a two-fiber connector (transmit and receive), has a form factor and, is used for enterprise equipment.
----------------------------------
- Unicast -- one device to one device
- broadcast -- one device to all devices in lan/
